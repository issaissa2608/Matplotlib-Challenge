# Matplotlib-Challenge

Background
In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. The analysis also generated all of the table and figures needed for the technical, and top-level summary report of the study. For this analysis both datasets imported, merged,cleaned and the aggregate data diplayed in to Python Pandas dataframes, visualized in Matplotlib, and other libraries used in order to make a stastical analysis. 


Observable Trends
•	The bar graph depicted that the drug Regimen 'Capomulin' has the maximum mice number and Propriva has the lowest number of mice.
•	It was also established from the boxplot that Ramicane was the only drug regimen that performed better than Capomulin in terms of treatment.
•	The scatter plot and the linear regression statistics depicted a strong correlation between the mouse weight and average tumor volume (i.e 0.84), which is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume increases.
•	The sex representation was balanced as it was shown in the pie chart that 51% of male were tested and 49% percent of female were tested.
•	From the selected drug regimen, it was depicted that capomulin and Ramicane reduces the size of the tumor better.
